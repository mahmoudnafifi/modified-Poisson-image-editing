This is the Matlab implementation of image blending using "MPB: A modified Poisson blending technique". We propose to reduce bleeding artifacts caused by the Poisson image editing (PIE) by relying on the boundary pixels of both target and source images rather than just those of the target. Our proposed technique suitable for use in video compositing as it avoids the flickering caused by bleeding artifacts (check our results of the conference paper [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVP5kSt8LuM)). Additionally, we propose to reduce the problem of color bleeding by using an additional alpha compositing step.
